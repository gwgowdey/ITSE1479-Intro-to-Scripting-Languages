Assignment: 
This assignment uses an input file.

The payroll department keeps a list of employee information for 
each pay period in a text file.  The format of each line of the 
file is the following:

<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>

You do not know how many employees are listed in the file.
Write a program that inputs a filename from the user (the file is 
supplied in the files for the assignment) and prints a report (to 
the python shell) of the wages paid to the employees for a given period. 
The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate headings. 
Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the 
wages paid for that period.

You will need to set up a test text file with the employee information 
in order to test your program. Include the test data file with your 
upload of your python file. Name the data file: testdata.txt

Pseudocode:
Input: File name as input from the user.
Processes: Opening the file from input and equation for wages paid.
Output: Print the column headers and wages paid to the employees
for a given period.

# Taking filename as input from the user.
FileName = input ("Enter the full file name with extension: ")

# Opening the file with read operation.
fp = open (FileName, "r")

# Printing the headers.
print ("\nLast Name      Hours Worked      Total Paid")

# Using for loop to iterate through the files.
for column in fp.readlines():
    values = column.strip().split()
    
    # Printing the wages paid for each employee from the input file.
    print("s% %d %.2f"%(values[0],int(values[1]),int(values[1])*float(values[2])))

# Closing the file.
fp.close()
